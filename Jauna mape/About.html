        <h1>About us</h1>
    </header>
    <p> Welcome to our website! This is the concept of a website where anyone would be able to search for information on symbolism, and to discover how it has changed across time and how it varies in different cultures. This website was inspired by our project work, which is also about symbolism in various types of media. Much of it is still a work in progress, but we sincerely hope that one day we could launch it and people could use it however they see fit. </p>
